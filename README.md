# Python Online Messaging App

This messaging app is coded using Python and a variety of API's associated with Python.

A messaging app that can be accessed by multiple users to chat with each other using an online server.
The server code can be laoded on any virtual or phisical server to enable communication.
The app automatically connects to the online server and allows for instant communication  to other connected users.

The problem was to create an app that can run on the client side whilst communicating to the server that is not on the local machine.
I solved this problem by using threading and different ports to connect and communicate with the server.
The GUI is done using tkinter, which is a very rudementary user interface API for Python.
